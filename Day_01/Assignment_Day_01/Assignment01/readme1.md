 Reflection:
       - Declarative vs. Imperative:
         Traditional JavaScript requires imperative code to manipulate the DOM, such as creating elements and setting their properties explicitly.
         React uses a declarative approach, where we describe the desired UI state and React takes care of updating the DOM to match this state.
       
       - Reusability and Composition:
         Traditional JavaScript requires manual management for reusing DOM elements, making it cumbersome for large applications.
         React promotes the use of reusable and composable components, making it easier to build and maintain complex UIs.
       
       - Performance:
         Direct DOM manipulation in traditional JavaScript can lead to inefficient reflows and repaints.
         React improves performance by using a virtual DOM to batch changes and minimize direct DOM manipulations.
       
       - State Management:
         Managing UI state with traditional JavaScript can become complex and error-prone as the application grows.
         React provides a clear structure for managing state and props, making it easier to build dynamic and interactive UIs.
